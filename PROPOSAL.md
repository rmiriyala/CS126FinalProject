# Project Proposal

#### The Idea
I plan on creating a program that will function, in essence, like Netflix.  The user will be able to play videos from a selected list of titles and have access to playback controls (such as pause, play, forward, rewind, etc.) using the application.  

#### Implementation
In order to do this, I will implement the [ofVideoPlayer library](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/video/ofVideoPlayer/), which allows for video playback and framerate controls.
