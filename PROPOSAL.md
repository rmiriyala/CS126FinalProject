# Project Proposal

#### The Idea
I plan on creating a program that will function, in essence, like Spotify.  The user will be able to play songs from a selected list of titles and have access to playback controls (such as pause, play, forward, rewind, etc.) using the application.  

#### Implementation
In order to do this, I will implement the [ofSoundPlayer library](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/sound/ofSoundPlayer/), which allows for audio playback volume and speed controls.  The player will be activated when the user clicks on a specific title, and will display info about the particular title (artist name, album, etc.) as well as the current position.  If possible, I plan to create a drag and drop feature to allow for audio scrubbing by the user.
